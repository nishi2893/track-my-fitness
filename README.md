# Track My Fitness


This project is built using Angular 7 and Angular Material. The application is a single page application with all the data of the application stored in firebase and accessed using Angular Fire 2 as well as it is mobile responsive.

This application tracks the fitness of the user. Firstly, the user can select one of the many workouts provided by the application. Once the user starts with a particular workout, this application records the duration of the workout completed as well as records the status of the workout which means whether the user has completed or cancelled a given workout.

The app has more functionalities like displaying all the past workouts carried out by the user with their respective duration and status. It even has the timer which will display the amount of workout completed in terms of percentage. 

More functionalities like calculation of calories burned, heart rate, etc as well as recommendation of a particular diet to the user based on their health conditions will be added in the project in future.
